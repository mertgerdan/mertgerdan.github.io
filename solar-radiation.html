<h1>Predicting Solar Radiation Using Machine Learning</h1>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#aaa;">
    <p>Using kNN-regressors and Random Forests, predicts Solar Radiation based on various data points such as temperature, time of day, wind speed, wind direction, and date; created an extensive report about the results obtained and presented to class. Turns out there is a correlation between solar radiation and some data points, who wouldâ€™ve guessed?
