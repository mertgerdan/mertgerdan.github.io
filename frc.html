<h1>First Robotics Competition</h1>

    <h2>Column 1</h2>
    <p>FRC is a robotics competition where teams have to design, prototype, build and optimize a ~100 pound robot in six weeks. The objectives that these robots are tasked with are mixed up every year, but usually involve launching projectiles into baskets, climbing a rope / slope, stacking boxes or tasks similar in nature. The teams are usually funded by seeking out sponsorships.
	I was introduced to FRC in 2016, when I joined the team HisaRobotics. I shadowed our then current programmer while learning the tools (LabView, Java on the programming end, Flash, Maya, After Effects on the animation end). I started writing code for the main robot around the start of 2017, responsible for I/O from the joystick and the implementation of the gyro sensor. This was also around the time we rebranded to become Hisar Ravens.
	In March of 2017, we went to our first regional event in Miami Valley, Ohio, thanks to some key sponsors.</p>
