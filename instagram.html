Built an instagram clone where users could login, post, and engage with other users’ posts with client-side dynamic pages using React, Python and HTML. First started by liking 3 posts of Prof. DeOrio’s chickens, then uploaded a fire selfie from my time in Istanbul, was sad to see it only received a single like. Took down the website from AWS promptly after.
