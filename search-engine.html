Search Engine (2021)
Wrote a scalable end-to-end search engine similar to Google or Bing which indexed Wikipedia instead of the whole world wide web, where I used information retrieval concepts like PageRank, tf-idf and parallel data processing with the MapReduce framework. Searched “How many chickens does DeOrio have?”, top answer returned was “too many”. I’d say the engine is pretty accurate.
