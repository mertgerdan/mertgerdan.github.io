<h1>Artistic Neural Style Slideshow</h1>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#aaa;">
    <p>Created an interactive multithreaded photo booth written in Python, used a pre-trained neural net to stylize photos. This was one of my favorite projects during high school, as this project has got me to pursue computer science in college. Although the neural network was pre-trained, I hoped that one day Iâ€™d be able to build one from scratch, and in the Winter 2022 semester, I'll be able to do that with the person whose neural net implementation I borrowed 3 years ago, Professor Justin Johnson, in EECS 498: Deep Learning for Computer Vision.</p><br>
